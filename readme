Project manager v.2

I'm using this set of scripts to do simple operations from cli.

For example, I can:
- open project folder (command: prj open project-name)
- change current directory in shell  (command: prj cd project-name)
- detect my external ip (command: prj ip) 
- calculate md5 hash from string (command: prj md5 string) 
- open php/google/mysql search (command: find [word1] [word2] ..  php!)
and other..

So, it's something like shortcuts but with some additional functionality.

It's not a "world change" project, but I found that it very useful for me, 
so I share it on Github to have opportunity to get it in any place.
